Microsoft recently shipped the latest version of [**Visual Studio**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and I'm looking forward to installing it. I suspect I've used [every version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio#History) of Visual Studio since the first, and Visual C++ before that, though my memory gets fuzzy going that far back. I've always been impressed at how well Microsoft has served its developers over the years, and I'm especially glad that they've embraced open source in recent years. There have been plenty of missteps along the way, but overall I'm glad that I've spent so much of my career steeped in Microsoft technologies.
