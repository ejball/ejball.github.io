I'm not one for horror movies, but I took a chance on [A Quiet Place](https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Place-Emily-Blunt/dp/B07BYSTXMF), since I'd heard so many good things about it. I enjoyed it. Interesting, suspenseful, optimistic. A little unbelievable at times, but you get that. Didn't linger on disturbing ideas or images. Recommended.
