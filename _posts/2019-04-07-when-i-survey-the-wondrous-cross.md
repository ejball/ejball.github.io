I love hymns. Not primarily for the style of music -- I can enjoy almost any style of music -- but for the powerful spiritual messages they convey. Words set to music engage my mind and soul like nothing else. Today we sang [When I Survey the Wondrous Cross](https://hymnary.org/text/when_i_survey_the_wondrous_cross_watts), one of my favorite lenten hymns.

> When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of glory died, my richest gain I count but loss, and pour contempt on all my pride. ... Were the whole realm of nature mine, that were a present far too small. Love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all.
