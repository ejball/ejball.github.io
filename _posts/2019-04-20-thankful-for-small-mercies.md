I lost my glasses today while I was at my daughter's tennis match. I had swapped them for my sunglasses and hung them on my shirt collar. A bit later, I felt for them and they were gone. My glasses are not cheap, and they are not optional anymore, at least for reading and coding. I backtracked, figured out why I must have bent over and dropped them, and found them resting comfortably in the grass. So today I am **thankful for small mercies**.
