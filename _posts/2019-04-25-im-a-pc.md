I've been using Microsoft Windows since I first installed it from MS-DOS. Which is to say, **I'm a PC**. (I loved [those ads](https://youtu.be/0eEG5LVXdKo), which aired 2006â€“2009.) I had a Mac in my office once upon a time, but I think it disintegrated from disuse. I can't really say anything bad about Macs because, well, I hardly ever use one. Though the reversed mouse wheel direction is comically frustrating for Windows users that sit down at a Mac. And I still think menus are better at the top of the window, not the top of the screen. And laptops should have touch screens. Of course, Windows has its own share of annoyances. To each his own.
