I [recently mentioned]({% post_url 2019-05-15-fantasy-novels-part-2 %}) that I've been reading some of the most popular fantasy series. I didn't make it through [The Sword of Shannara trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49525-the-original-shannara-trilogy), but I really enjoyed the [Mistborn series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40910-mistborn) by Brandon Sanderson. The [Earthsea Cycle](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40909-earthsea-cycle) was pretty good. The [Kingkiller Chronicle](https://www.goodreads.com/series/45262-the-kingkiller-chronicle) was unique, but I didn't enjoy as much as I was supposed to. I liked the [The Way of Kings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings), also by Brandon Sanderson, but the books in that series are really long and I haven't yet found the time to read the next one. Finally, I just read [The Black Prism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38819122-the-black-prism), by Brent Weeks, which I enjoyed, and I'm sure I'll continue the series at some point, though I prefer Sanderson. Anyway, that concludes a whirlwind tour of my experience so far with **fantasy novels**.
