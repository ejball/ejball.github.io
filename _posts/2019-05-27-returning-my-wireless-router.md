title: Returning My Wireless Router

I'm **returning my wireless router** to the manufacturer today. Last fall, my old wireless router died and I decided to spend a little extra to get better performance, especially streaming HD video on the other side of the house. I wasn't prepared to invest in "mesh" -- my house just isn't big enough -- but I did spend a bit extra on a [TP-LINK Archer C2300](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XZ3S6B8/). Maybe not enough extra, because it has been regularly overheating lately. It gets so hot that it reboots, frequently, unless I point a fan at it. So I get to pay to have it shipped to the manufacturer and hope they actually send a working router back to me in a reasonable amount of time. Considering that they have three tiers of expedited processing where I can spend up to $50 for faster service, I'm guessing the free option isn't going to be especially fast. Fortunately I was able to borrow an old router in the meantime; hopefully we won't suffer too much.
