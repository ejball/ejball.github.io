title: Returning My Wireless Router

I started the process of **returning my wireless router** to the manufacturer this weekend. Last fall, my old wireless router died and I decided to spend a little extra to get better performance, especially streaming HD video on the other side of the house. I wasn't prepared to invest in "mesh" -- my house just isn't big enough -- but I did spend a bit extra on a [TP-LINK Archer C2300](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XZ3S6B8/). Maybe not enough extra, because it has been regularly overheating lately. It gets so hot that it reboots, frequently, unless I point a fan at it. So, for $15, they will send me a replacement and provide a shipping label for me to send this one back once I get it. Hopefully it all works out in the end and the new one doesn't overheat as well...
