I haven't been blogging much lately, because **all I wanna do is write some code**. My work assignments are engaging enough that I'm still thinking about them when I'm not at work, and I've got at least three personal projects I'd love to work on, not the least of which is finally shipping version 2 of [Facility](https://facilityapi.github.io/). But more important life things have a way of crowding out extracurricular coding time.
