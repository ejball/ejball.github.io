Of the many **things said to Jesus** as recorded in the Gospels, three are especially meaningful to me. The last was spoken to him on the first Good Friday:
* “I believe; help my unbelief!” (Mark 9:23-24)
* “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.” (John 6:68-69)
* “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” (Luke 23:42-43)
