I've developed almost exclusively in **C#** since C# 2.0 was released back in 2005. I had been a die-hard C++ developer to that point (with some JavaScript experience as well), but once it had generics, C# was a welcome relief from the more annoying aspects of C++, especially when using it to do object-oriented programming with COM and ATL. The language has gotten better and better over the years, and I love how they continue to adopt some of the best features of other languages so that I don't have to feel tempted by them. I am definitely not a polyglot when it comes to programming languages, as I'm far more comfortable striving for expertise in a few technologies than being useful with many, so I suspect I will stick with C# for many years to come.
