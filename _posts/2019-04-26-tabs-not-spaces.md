My blog is a perfect place to admit that I prefer **tabs, not spaces**. The tab character is designed for indentation and avoids the possibility of partial indentation. Modern text editors correct for most of the issues with using spaces as indentation, so I'm honestly happy to adopt whatever standard my team prefers, but for my own code, I still love my tabs.
