I was glad to see that at least [one](https://twitter.com/bgrainger/status/1117302031549550593) of my ones of readers caught [my reference](/blog/one-room-schoolhouses/) to [**It's All About the Pentiums**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_All_About_the_Pentiums) by "Weird Al" Yankovic. The lyrics and video are a bit PG, but it went viral among computer nerds like myself back before going viral was a thing. It's full of hilariously obsolete culture references, not the least of which is "I ain't afraid of Y2K," which, as it turned out, he had no need to be.
