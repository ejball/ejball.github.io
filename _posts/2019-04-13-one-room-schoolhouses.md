In a rare intersection of code life and real life, I used my mad programming skills to solve an elementary school problem that my wife told me about (she’s a Kindergarten teacher). They want to rearrange the K–4 classes into 18 **one-room schoolhouses** where pairs of kids from each classroom leave for another classroom that has kids from every grade. It took me a bit longer than I'd hoped, but I wrote a little program that generates 18 pages with the names of the students that will come and go from each classroom. It was fun!
