Tonight Julie and I will start season 8 of [**Blue Bloods**](https://www.netflix.com/title/70177083), a TV show about the close-knit family of a police commissioner of New York City, his cop sons, and his prosecutor daughter. We like to wind down in the evening with one episode of television (we are decidedly not "binge watchers") but it isn't always easy to find a show we both enjoy. I'm always impressed at how many story threads get started, how many cast members get screen time, and how neatly everything gets wrapped up within 40 minutes, with the family all together for Sunday dinner at some point.
