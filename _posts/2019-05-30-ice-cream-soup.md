Does anything melt faster than ice cream? An individual who I will not publicly shame here left the freezer open a crack for a few hours. Most everything was still frozen solid, but the ice cream was three gallons of **ice cream soup**. At least it's still decent when it freezes again... (What, you don't have three gallons of ice cream in your freezer? Maybe you don't live near an [awesome dairy](https://www.edaleendairy.com/) that sells amazing vanilla ice cream in three-gallon buckets for $20.)
