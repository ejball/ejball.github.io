[**SmartGit**](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/) has been one of my favorite development tools since we moved from Subversion to Git for source control. You'd think that someone who has been tinkering with computers for 35 years would be comfortable on the command line, but memorizing arcane command-line syntax is just not something that my brain is good at, so I love a good user interface, and SmartGit provides an excellent one for Git, supporting just about every feature of the `git` command line tool, in a way that I can understand and remember.
