I read and write code in a **proportionally-spaced font** rather than a fixed-width font whenever possible. I find that it reads more naturally and I like seeing more code per line. Fixed-width fonts are necessary for vertical alignment; fortunately for me, I dislike vertical alignment anywhere but indentation (it's a pain to maintain and I don't personally find that it usually makes the code easier to read). In Visual Studio I use Verdana 8pt (and the more compressed Tahoma 8pt for tool windows). Visual Studio Code doesn't display it as crisply, so I use Verdana 13px there. When I must use a fixed-width font, I prefer Consolas.
