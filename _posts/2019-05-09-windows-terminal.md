I'm pretty excited about the upcoming [**Windows Terminal**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-windows-terminal/). The standard Windows command prompt is pretty terrible, so I've been using [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/), but I would love an official tabbed console that I don't have to install. I'm not so excited that I'm going to [build it from the source code](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal), but I will gladly install the first preview that ships to the Microsoft Store. (I'm also eager to use it with the new [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/announcing-wsl-2/) that will be released this summer!)
