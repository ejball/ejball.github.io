I don't own many printed books, but one thing I've kept around is [The Complete Calvin and Hobbes](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Calvin-Hobbes-Box-Set/dp/0740748475/). I don't know how long it had been since the last time, but I just read through it again and thoroughly enjoyed it. I loved reading newspaper comics growing up, and [**Calvin and Hobbes**](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes) was easily my favorite. Itâ€™s been almost twenty-five years since Bill Watterson retired the strip, but his criticisms of modern society have only gotten more relevant. And, of course, it is hilarious.
