When I'm writing code, I give myself plenty of time to think about **naming**. Good names are one of the best ways to produce code that can be read and understood. In fact, I've come to believe that good names make most code comments unnecessary. I try not to be unreasonable about it -- not every name is worth pondering for 15 minutes. But I do take my time with names that can't be easily changed -- repository names, the public API of published libraries, web service APIs, etc.
