My email inbox has been a little less crowded since I started using [**Octobox**](https://octobox.io/). It presents all of my GitHub notifications in a handy user interface, making it easy to browse what's new and archive it all when I'm done. I turned off my email notifications when I started using it, so I just have to remember to visit the Octobox website every so often to catch up.
