I've always been a stickler for coding style. In fact, many (many) years ago, my boss deputized me as the **code police** and even gave me a sheriff's badge. I have since mellowed considerably on the finer details, but I still insist on consistency. Like many software developers, I have a knack for noticing inconsistencies, to the point that they distract me when I'm trying to understand or modify code. I've still got my personal preferences, but I can cope with a codebase that deviates from them, at least if it does so consistently.
