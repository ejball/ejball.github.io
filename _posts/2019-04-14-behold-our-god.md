Itâ€™s hard to predict what congregational music will resonate with a church, but we sang [**Behold Our God**](https://sovereigngracemusic.org/music/songs/behold-our-god-who-has-held-the-oceans/) pretty enthusiastically today, especially at the chorus:

> Behold our God seated on His throne<br>
> Come, let us adore Him<br>
> Behold our King! Nothing can compare<br>
> Come, let us adore Him!
