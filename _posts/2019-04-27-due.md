If you know me well, you won't be surprised that [**Due**](https://www.dueapp.com/) is the most important app on my iPhone. The killer feature of Due is its nagging persistence. It doesn't just ding/buzz at me once; it bugs me every minute until I acknowledge it. Because I'm liable to completely miss the first alert, or ignore the second, but eventually I will attend to it. And if I've set an alarm, I need to attend to it. Basically, if I need to remember to do something at a certain time, it goes in Due, and if I forget to put it in Due, I'll probably forget to do it. I can reduce the nag to 5 minutes or even 60 minutes for less pressing reminders. My family is especially grateful for the "Leave work" alarm that goes off at 4:27 PM every weekday; otherwise, who knows when I'd remember to head home...
