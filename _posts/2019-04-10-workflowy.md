[**Workflowy**](https://workflowy.com/) is by far the website that I would miss the most if it was gone, both in my personal and my professional life. It is the perfect note-taking tool for my brain. I have always loved outlines and bullet lists, and Workflowy combines the two into an outstanding user interface for creating, editing, finding, marking as completed, and even sharing with others. Even if I didn't need the features of Workflowy Pro, I'd pay for it anyway because it is the productivity tool I was always waiting for.
