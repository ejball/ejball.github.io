I've always been somewhat interested in the fantasy genre, but I actually didn't read much as a kid, so I mostly enjoyed it in movies and video games. I did read some **fantasy novels** when I was young, particularly [The Chronicles of Narnia](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49073-the-chronicles-of-narnia-publication-order) and [The Hobbit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5907.The_Hobbit_or_There_and_Back_Again). I finally got through [The Lord of the Rings](https://www.goodreads.com/series/66175-the-lord-of-the-rings) when I was a bit older (now my all-time favorite novel). I'll talk about the books I've read since in a [future post]({% post_url 2019-05-13-fantasy-novels-part-2 %}), but while we're on the subject, when it comes to The Chronicles of Narnia, I'm on [Team Publication Order](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/trevin-wax/why-you-should-narnia-in-publication-order/). Isn't everyone?
