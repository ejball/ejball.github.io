I just added an [Atom feed](/blog/atom.xml) to this blog. Which makes this as good a time as any to mention [**Feedly**](https://feedly.com/), one of my favorite websites. Remember [Google Reader](https://www.google.com/reader/about/) and RSS feeds? Feedly filled the gaping hole that Google Reader left behind, and there are still plenty of blogs and websites out there that support RSS/Atom feeds. It's a great way to keep tabs on a large number of websites without having to visit them all. One of these days, the number of websites with feeds that I want to follow might drop to the point where I don't need it any more, but for now I find Feedly very useful.
