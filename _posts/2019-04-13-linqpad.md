[**LINQPad**](https://www.linqpad.net/) is an indispensable tool for C# developers. Itâ€™s great for experimenting and for one-off data munging. I even used it this weekend to [write a script for my wife](/blog/one-room-schoolhouses/): it reads data from a text file, runs a basic brute-force algorithm, and builds a Word document from the results. The premium version of LINQPad is totally worth it (especially if your employer foots the bill).
